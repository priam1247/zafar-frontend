# Zafar

A study library for Malawian secondary students: MANEB MSCE/JCE past papers,
mocks, textbooks, summary notes and marking keys.

## Layout

```
web/                     static frontend (no build step, no framework)
  login.html             sign in          }  entry point — the site now
  register.html          create account   }  starts here, not on a
  verify.html            email code       }  marketing landing page
  dashboard.html         past papers
  books.html             textbooks
  notes.html             summary notes
  marking-keys.html      marking keys
  favorites.html         saved documents, across every section
  help.html              FAQ
  assets/css/app.css     design system for the signed-in app, token driven
  assets/css/auth.css    the authentication screen — self-contained, so the
                         app stylesheet can be re-skinned without touching it
  assets/fonts/…         Instrument Sans, 29 KB variable (the only webfont)
  assets/img/hero.jpg    brand photograph — no longer used by the auth screen
  assets/js/config.js    API client, token storage, favorites, formatting
  assets/js/i18n.js      the English string table for the signed-in app
  assets/js/shell.js     sidebar + topbar + drawer + toasts
  assets/js/list.js      the shared document-list page
  assets/js/auth.js      sign in / create account / verify
server.js                zero-dependency static server for local development
worker.js                Cloudflare Worker that signs + streams Drive downloads
```

The sidebar and topbar are rendered once from `shell.js`, and every list page
(papers, books, notes, marking keys, favorites) is one call to
`ZafarList.init({...})` — so a change to a card or a filter lands everywhere.
Likewise `auth.js` builds the whole sign-in screen, and `login.html`,
`register.html` and `verify.html` are 20-line shells that differ only in which
panel opens first.

## Design

**The authentication screen** (`auth.css`) is the current reference design.
A teal panel carries the brand and a white sheet carries the form: centred
title, pill fields with leading icons, one pill CTA. Two colours do the work —
teal `#006D7C` for every piece of text, border and the CTA, mint `#CFEBE1` for
highlights on the teal panel only (mint on cream is invisible, so it never
appears there). Amber `#B26A14` is reserved for errors and notices. Contrast:
teal on the sheet 5.9:1, cream on the teal CTA 5.9:1, mint on teal 4.8:1.

One webfont, self-hosted: Instrument Sans, 29 KB, variable 100–900. No shadows
anywhere — depth comes from the teal block against the sheet and one hairline.
The design is **phone-only**. The sheet fills whatever height is left, the
form is centred with `margin-block: auto` and the footer is pinned, so no
screen ends in a dead band. There is no desktop layout at all: on a wide screen
the column keeps its 470px phone width and centres itself, so what you see on a
phone is what you see everywhere. Type is fixed in px — nothing scales with the
viewport — so the two never drift apart.

The mobile header carries a CSS-drawn library — floating past-paper cards over
a shelf of book spines — which costs zero bytes. Phones therefore never
download a hero image.

**The signed-in app** (past papers, books, notes, marking keys, favourites,
help) still runs on the previous forest-green/cream tokens in `app.css`. It has
not been re-skinned to the new system yet.

## Running locally

```bash
node server.js            # http://localhost:4173
```

Zero dependencies — `server.js` only serves `web/` and refuses paths outside it.

## Backend

`API_BASE_URL` in `web/assets/js/config.js` points at the deployed FastAPI
backend. Endpoints used:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/auth/register` | create an account — `{email, password, name}` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | issue a JWT (form-encoded: `email`, `password`) |
| POST | `/auth/verify` | confirm the 6-digit email code — `{email, code}` |
| POST | `/auth/resend` | send a fresh verification code — `{email}` |
| GET | `/auth/quota` | today's remaining paper/book downloads |
| GET | `/drive/papers` | catalogue, filtered by `section`, `category`, `q` |
| POST | `/drive/download/{id}` | spend quota, return a short-lived signed URL |
| POST | `/drive/confirm/{download_id}` | confirm the bytes actually arrived |

Override the backend per-session with `?api=https://…` on any page.

There is no demo mode — the app always talks to the real backend. When it
can't be reached, each page shows a clear error or offline state instead of
fake data, so what you see is always what's actually published.

## Downloads

The catalogue response never carries a file URL — a permanent link there would
let the daily quota be bypassed from the network tab. Each click calls
`POST /drive/download/{id}`, which enforces the quota and returns a signed,
expiring URL for `worker.js`. The Worker verifies the HMAC and streams the file
from Drive with a correct `Content-Disposition`; the page then hands the browser
a same-origin blob so the filename survives.

## Known gaps

- **The app still uses the old palette.** The auth screen is on teal/mint;
  past papers, books, notes, marking keys, favourites and help are still on
  forest green over cream in `app.css`. Signing in therefore changes colour
  scheme. Porting the tokens across is the next piece of work.
- `assets/img/hero.jpg` (1.5 MB) is no longer used by any page. It is kept for
  a future landing page; nothing loads it today.

- `/auth/forgot-password` and `/auth/reset-password` don't exist server-side
  yet. The sign-in screen has both panels built and wired to validation, but
  submitting says so plainly instead of faking success — swap the banner in
  `wireForgot()` for the real calls when the endpoints land.
- The app is English-only and light-only. The former EN/Chichewa toggle and
  the dark-mode toggle were removed; `assets/js/i18n.js` is now a plain
  English string table, and the theme boots straight to the light palette.
  The separate dashboard overview page was also removed — signing in now
  lands directly on Past Papers.
